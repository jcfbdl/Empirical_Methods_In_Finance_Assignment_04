\chapter{Static asset allocation with constant expected returns and volatility}
Consider a mean-variance criterion for asset allocation:
\begin{equation}
    \underset{\{ a\}}{\textrm{max}} \hspace{0.3cm} \mu_p - \frac{\lambda}{2} \hspace{0.15cm} \sigma_p ^2 , \hspace{0.7cm} \mu = \alpha ' + (1 - e' \alpha)R_f, \hspace{0.7cm} \sigma_p ^2 = \alpha' \Sigma \alpha
\end{equation}

\subsection{Give the expression for the optimal portfolio weights.}
We can compute the first order conditions, which are the following:
$$
\mu - \lambda \Sigma \alpha = 0
$$
and the optimal weights $\alpha^\star$ are given by:
$$
\alpha^\star = \frac{1}{\lambda} \Sigma^{-1} \mu
$$


\subsection{Assume that expected returns are given by sample means and that the covariance
matrix is given by the sample covariance matrix. Compute the optimal weight vector $\alpha^\star$ for and $\lambda = 2$ and 10.}
